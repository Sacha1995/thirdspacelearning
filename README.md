# Homage Piece Third Space Learning

This assignment we were tasked with recreating a website, for this piece I choose https://thirdspacelearning.com/ and I set out to copy the look and feel of the website. There were some tricky parts as we weren't allowed to use JavaScript yet and everything was completed with just html and css. Iâ€™m particularly pleased with the resemblance of my piece and it also gave me valuable lessons on how to construct the interactive portions of the website.
